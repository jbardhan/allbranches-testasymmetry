testSymmetric.m:

1. Set up sphere and grid of internal points for reaction potential
sampling. Call this pqrReacGrid

2. Also set up a (fine) grid of points on a line from the sphere
center to near the surface.  

3. For each source in pqrSourceChargeLine, compute the "perfect" self
solvation energy (E_SourceChargeLine), and compute the corresponding
effective Born radius (R_eff_SourceChargeLine)

4. For each grid point in pqrReacGrid, also compute the effective Born
radius R_eff_ReacGrid.

5. For each source in pqrSourceChargeLine, compute the GB reaction
potential for each pqrReacGrid point (this is why you need step 4
above).
